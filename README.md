# Intelligent Automation Framework (Python)

## Overview

The Intelligent Automation Framework is a Python-based automation project designed to simulate real-world QA and production-support workflows.

This framework demonstrates how automation can be applied to:

- API validation and response monitoring
- System health diagnostics
- Log file analysis and error detection
- Modular and reusable automation design

The project reflects practical automation scenarios commonly encountered in QA, DevOps, and IT environments.
